# iCake 🍰

This is a personal project created to help me improve as a developer while also solving a real-world problem. The idea is to build an order management app, initially focused on homemade sweets. The app aims to help small-scale bakers organize their orders more efficiently, keep track of clients, and streamline communication. It’s designed to make it easier for them to manage their business, provide a better service, and promote their products.

## 🔧 Stack

- Backend: Java + Spring Boot
- Frontend: React
- Database: MySQL
- Messaging (future): RabbitMQ
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Containerized with Docker

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Run the full stack (backend, frontend, db)
docker-compose up --build
